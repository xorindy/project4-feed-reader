# Project #4: Feed Reader Testing

Testing is an important part of any development process, also known as "test-driven application development". Developers are able to organize their code, and keep it functional, while ensuring that their applications perform correctly.
I used the Javascript testing framework, Jasmine. My assignment was to write tests for a web-based RSS feed reader application (already given to me).

## How to run the application:
    
1. Download from github (click the green button "Clone or Download").
2. Click "Download ZIP" and extract the zip to your computer (You may opt to clone the repository on github).
3. Navigate extracted files or cloned repository directory in your computer.
4. Double-click index.html to open application on any web browser.
